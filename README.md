# Human-Benchmark-Visual-Test-Bot
A Python Selenium bot which memorizes and plays the visual test from https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/memory. Before each round, the bot creates a list of active squares, the memorization step. Afterwards, it clicks on each square based off the memorized locations.
